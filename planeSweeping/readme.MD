The purpose of this code is to implement the plane sweeping method for depth maps. 

The main file is 'planeSweep.m'.
Inputs are light fields from the Heidelberg and Stanford light field datasets which can be found in this repository. 
The code does not run on the entire light field for the sake of time but if you're interested on the run time, this can be viewed in our project report. 

Outputs: 
Figure 1: ground truth depth map (if using Heidelberg dataset), otherwise, please comment this out if you're using the Stanford light field dataset as there is not ground truth for this. 
Figure 2: depth map created by plane sweeping algorithm. 


Thank you!
